# Runtime:
limited_infection_type=='ALL_RELATIONS_RECUR'


# Optimizations and updates that could have been made:
Could have done a recursive query instead of the wierd thing I did that mixed python and sql

# Questions that may come up
What are some other SQL queries that I can run?


How do you check if two users are in the same course?


# Background on SQLITE indicies and run times
## SQLITE indexes:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_indexes.htm

## Run time of SQLITE Queries:
https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html
SQLITE full table Scan = O(N)
Lookup by RowID = O(logN)
SELECT price FROM fruitsforsale WHERE rowid=4;

After creating an Index, SQL lite will do 2 binary searches.
First one on the indexed column, eg to get username to rowID,
then a second search to find that rowID

## Primary key vs index:
-need to have one primary key (primary key = for uniqueness)
-can have many indexes (index= for uniqueness and for performance)
